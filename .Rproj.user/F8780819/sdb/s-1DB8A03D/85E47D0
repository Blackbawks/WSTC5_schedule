Spend some time looking through the conference manual and noting which \n                             presentations you would like to see. Each session is separated by a break - use these to reach out\n                             if you didn't manage to do so during the session. Always remember to use the #WSTC4 hashtag to \n                             allow others to see and join the conversation!</li>\n                             </ul>\"),\n                        img(src='BethTweetPic.jpg'),\n                        HTML(\"<ul>\n                             <li>You can help draw in a very large audience if you use hashtags in a clever way. \n                             Many people follow hashtags such as #ornithology and #seabirds and depending on your topic of \n                             presentation you may be able to draw in a much larger audience than just the \n                             conference attendees.

This event is meant to bring together seabird scientists from around the world in an online setting to encourage communication and collaboration, particularly when costs of travel are currently high.</h4>\n                             <h3><strong>How do I participate?</strong></h3>\n                             <h4>Start by getting a twitter account if you don't already have one - you can get one easily at http://www.twitter.com. If you are interested in being a spectator only, you only need to search for the twitter hashtag #WSTC4 to see all posts related to the conference. If you want to present, please register and submit an abstract before the deadline.</h4>\n                             <h3><strong>How much time am I expected to spend on this if I participate?</strong></h3>\n                             <h4>After the signup closes, everyone will be allocated a 15 minute time slot for you to present your 4 tweets. It is vital that you are available during your presentation time slot to present and then answer potential questions you might receive, indeed just like at any conference. After signup closes, we will circulate a list of abstracts and time slots so that you can pinpoint which presentations you might want to catch. You are encouraged to participate is much or as little as you would like.</h4>\n                             <h3><strong>What if I am unable to present during my time slot?</strong></h3>\n                             <h4>If you are unable to present during your allocated time slot, you can schedule your tweets (using services such as Tweetdeck, Hootsuite, or Buffer) so that they get posted automatically without you having to be online.</h4>\n                             <h3><strong>What if I don't know how to use twitter?</strong></h3>\n                             <h4>The key is experience - no better way to learn about twitter than on the site.
